# MangaStream Bot
Playing around with [Botkit](https://botkit.ai) to create a bot to go out to [MangaStream](https://mangastream.com) and pull in the latest mangas listed on the homepage. 
Using [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [x-ray](https://www.npmjs.com/package/x-ray). Want to give credit to [pmcalabrese](https://github.com/pmcalabrese/amazon-scraper) for his source code to assist with using Promises.
